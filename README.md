# Summer of 2025-projects
Welcome to my **Summer of 2025** repository!<br>
This is where I document and store all my coding projects, experiment and learning activities I will be working on over the summer to build my skills and portfolio. <br>
## About This Repository
- Contains Python programs, AI models, data analysis, and web projects.
- Focuses on real-world problems, particularly problems in Ethiopia, such as:
  - Plant health diagnosis using AI
  - Soil data visualization and analysis
  - Educational coding tools and games
  - Automation and data-driven mini projects
 - Includes code, documentation, and notes for each project.
 - Serves as a portfolio to demonstrate my progress and skills for college applications.
